# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Create 2 buttons - increment and decrement, clicking on both the counter is incremented and decremented by 1 respectively. Max value can be 10 and min can be 0. If the counter reaches either state, that particular button is disabled.
Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
